# 🤵🏻 About me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University (浙江大学), Hangzhou, China and also Westlake University (西湖大学), Hangzhou, China supervised by Prof. Xiaofei Li (李晓飞). 
I received the M.S. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China (中国科学技术大学), Hefei, China, in 2022, supervised by Prof. Zhongfu Ye (叶中付). 
I received the B.E. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Xidian University (西安电子科技大学), Xi'an, China, in 2019. 

My research interests include audio signal processing, array signal processing, and machine learning.
